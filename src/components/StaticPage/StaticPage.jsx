                                    <p>If you create an account using, or otherwise connect your account to, 
                                        a social networking services account (e.g. Twitter or Facebook), 
                                        we may also collect information provided to us by such social networking service 
                                        including for example your: name; email address; birthday; geographic location; interests; 
                                        profile picture; gender; networks; user ID; list of friends; and any information you have made 
                                        public on such social networking account.
                                    We automatically collect information about how you use our services, for example, 
                                    pages you have viewed. We also collect certain technical information about your device including your Internet protocol address, geo-location information, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and application version, device types, device model and manufacturer, device identifiers, and your device operating system type and version.
                                    We also use cookies, Web beacons, and URL information to gather information regarding the date and 
                                    time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. Cookies are small 
                                    pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. 
                                    We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies 
                                    (which usually stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and 
                                    interactive experience on our Site. Web beacons are digital images that are used to log information on 
                                    the Services or in our emails. We use Web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what 
                                    marketing works and what does not. We also use Web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.
                                    Others, including third party analytics service providers and advertising partners may also 
                                    collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and 
                                    across different Web sites when you use our Services, including as described in this Privacy 
                                    Policy. This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for those other parties. 
                                    Third party analytics services may use cookies and web beacons through our Site 
                                    (for example Google Analytics) to provide us with information about how you use and interact 
                                    with our Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties to 
                                    learn about your choices about information they collect from you.</p>

Please be mindful of your own privacy needs as you choose who to connect with and what to share and make public.

                                <h2>How we Disclose Your Information</h2>
                                <p>
                                    We may share your information as follows:
                                </p>
                                    <p>1. We may share your personal information with your consent or at your direction.</p>
                                    <p>2. We may also share your information with others who perform services on our behalf.</p>
                                    <p>3. We may disclose your information if we believe we are required to do so by law, or to 
                                        comply with a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant.</p>
                                    <p>4. We also may disclose your information if we believe doing so is appropriate or necessary to prevent any 
                                    liability, or fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or to protect DeViine and our Services; or any rights, property, 
                                    or personal safety of DeViine or others.</p>
                                   <p> 5. In the event that DeViine is or may be acquired by or merged with another company or involved in any other business deal 
                                       (or negotiation of a business deal) involving sale or transfer of all or part of our business or assets, 
                                       we may transfer or assign your information as part of or in connection with the transaction. 
                                       Finally, in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, information may be transferred as 
                                       a business asset.
